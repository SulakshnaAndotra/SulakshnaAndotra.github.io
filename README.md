## Project Requirements

### Content
 I have used my headshot image for my profile picture in my hero section. My hero section is for my introduction and my profile pitcure. After the hero section, I have created my biography. My biography exlained about my education and my skills as a ICT professional. After this biography is my project section, which include a button, which can take the user to another webpage to showcase my projects. My contact form includes inputs and lables and a submit button. My socail media sites icons works perfectly and open into a new webpage. 
- [ ] At least one profile picture
- [ ] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [ ] Functional Contact Form
- [ ] "Projects" section
- [ ] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.
​
### Technical
 I have created 2 web pages, which are linked with a button from the home page. I have choosed a very soft color for my webpage. I have used hover property alot for my buttons to make the responsivness a little impactful. I have commit and pushed the code everytime I have added something new. I wanted my "my porjevt button" to be open into a new webpage, but i am trobleshooted this as I needed to use tage <a> for this purpose. I will do this futher for the web page. I am strugging with displaying my webpage on smaller screens, I have created the webpage for a lager screen. I think I need more help to understand this part better. 

- [ ] At least 2 web pages.
- [ ] Version controlled with Git
- [ ] Deployed on GitHub pages.
- [ ] Implements responsive design principles.
- [ ] Uses semantic HTML.

### Bonus (optional)
 I have used different style for my buttons and lins for hover. I have not use javascripts yet but will be in future.
- [ ] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)
